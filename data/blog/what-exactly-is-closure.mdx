You might have heard the term "closure" or being asked about it in a job interview. But what exactly is closure? What is it used for and how does it work? In this article, we'll take a look at the concept of closure in Javascript.

## What is closure?

Based on the definition from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)
> a closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function's scope from an inner function. In Javascript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

## How does it work?

Okay, let's break it down. For the first part of the definition, it's pretty straightforward that an inner function has access to the variables of the outer function.

```js
const outer = () => {
  const message = 'Hello, ';
  const inner = () => {
    console.log(message + 'world!');
  }
  return inner;
}

const inner = outer();
inner(); // Hello, world!
```

In the given example, the `inner` function has access to the `message` variable from the `outer` function. This is because the `inner` function is created inside the `outer` function and it has access to the variables of the `outer` function.

For the second part, it says that closures are created every time a function is created. This means that every time you create a function, a closure is created along with it.

```js
const outer = () => {
  let count = 0;
  return () => {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  }
}

const firstIncrement = outer();
const secondIncrement = outer();

firstIncrement(); // 1
firstIncrement(); // 2
SecondIncrement(); // 1 
```

In this example, we have two closures created by calling the `outer` function twice. Each closure has its own `count` variable that is independent of each other. 

Could you guess the output of the following example?

```js
function outer() {
  let firstCount = 0;

  function firstInner() {
    firstCount++;
    console.log(firstCount);
  }

  let secondCount = firstCount;

  function secondInner() {
    secondCount++;
    console.log(secondCount);
  }

  return [firstInner, secondInner];
}

const [firstIncrement, secondIncrement] = outer();
firstIncrement();
firstIncrement();
secondIncrement();
```

Let's give it a try and see if you can guess the output.

The output will be: `1 2 1`. If you guessed it right, congratulations! If not, don't worry, it's a bit tricky.

When the `outer` function is called, the closure is created for both `firstInner` and `secondInner` functions. Even though they share the same closure but at the time of closure creation, the `secondCount` variable is assigned the value of `firstCount` which is `0`. So, when the `secondIncrement` function is called, it increments the `secondCount` variable from `0` to `1`.
