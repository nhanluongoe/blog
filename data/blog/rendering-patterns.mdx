summary: 'Look into CSR, SSR, and SSG rendering patterns in web development.'

For the first part of this series, we will look into three popular rendering patterns in web development:

- Client-Side Rendering (CSR)
- Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
- Static Site Generation (SSG)

# CSR

CSR is the most common rendering pattern in modern web development. In CSR, the browser downloads a minimal HTML document and Javascript bundles. Most of the application logic is executed on the client-side, which means the the client is reponsible for rendering the UI with the data fetched from the server via API calls. The entire web application is loaded on the first request. As the user navigates, there will be no new request to the server for rendering the pages. It became popular as a method of building single-page applications (SPAs).

## Pros

- Fast navigation between pages without a page fresh.
- Rich user interaction applications.

## Cons

- Not SEO-friendly because the content is not rendered fast enough for the search engine to index it.
- Slow initial load time due to the large Javascript bundle size.

## When to use

- When building a web application that requires rich user interaction.
- When SEO is not a concern.
- The content is dynamic and changes frequently.
